<h2>The Tranquility Within Us</h2>

<p>There is within Buddhist imagery, the visualisation of consciousness being a very deep body of water, where there are waves on the surface, but tranquility underneath these surface waves. Most live focused on the surface, feeling themselves thrown around by the superficial events of life. The idea is that under these relatively shallow waves is a great depth of calm which cannot be disturbed by surface movements. </p>

<h2>Finding Peace</h2>

<p>I have been meditating since 2003. Sometimes, I go for a while. Sometimes, I get distracted. I have been meditating daily since early July. Four months of meditating every day (except one after having a tooth extracted). At least once a day, on a few weekends twice a day. Meditating through tooth pain. Meditating through daily distractions. What has happened? I have reached a state of tranquility that not only exists in meditation itself, but carries into the rest of my life. I sit at my desk and notice the breath. I have the benefits of meditation. I walk through the city and feel the earth against my feet. I feel the benefits of meditation. </p>

<h2>Living in the Depths of Consciousness</h2>

<p>The point of meditation is not just to feel contentment while in meditation – meditation can have its own discomforts – but to bring the tranquility, the equanimity, the insights into the rest of your life. You realise and live in the depths of yourself, not distracted by the surface disturbances. </p>

<p>If you haven't tried meditation, I strongly recommend it. Start easily and slowly. A few minutes is enough to begin with - you can add a minute a week until you get used to sitting with your thoughts. There is no "success" and no "failure". You will learn to watch your thoughts come and go. You will discover the calm under the surface waves. The tranquility is there inside of you, always.</p>

<p>Aroha nui,</p>
