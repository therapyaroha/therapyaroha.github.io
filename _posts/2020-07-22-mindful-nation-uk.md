<h2>Mindfulness All-Party Parliamentary Group</h2>

<p>A parliamentary working group created to research mindfulness, such groups are known as <i>All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs)</i> and are:</p> 

<p><blockquote> . . . informal cross-party groups of UK politicians who join together to pursue a particular topic or interest area. They are essentially run by and for Members of the Commons and Lords, although many groups involve individuals and organisations from outside Parliament in their administration and activities.</blockquote></p>

<p>This group was set up in 2014 with the expressed purpose:</p>

<p><blockquote>To review research evidence, current best practice, extent and success of implementation, and potential developments in the application of mindfulness within a range of policy areas, and to develop policy recommendations for government based on these findings.</blockquote></p>

<p>The group's findings supported both the effectiveness of mindfulness and continued use and research into its application across multiple domains, including work, school, healthcare and prisons. In calling for increased focus on mindfulness application in the UK, the group stated:</p>

<p><blockquote>We have been impressed by the quality and range of evidence for the benefits of mindfulness and believe it has the potential to help many people to better health and flourishing. On a number of issues ranging from improving mental health and boosting productivity and creativity in the economy through to helping people with long-term conditions such as diabetes and obesity, mindfulness appears to have an impact. This is a reason for government to take notice and we urge serious consideration of our report</blockquote></p>

<p>While Mindfulness has been researched extensively in relation to psychological interventions (e.g. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction), this document suggests ways in which Mindfulness can be used in other areas - some not within their criticisms, such as using a practice that grew out of spiritual practice to increase work productivity.</p>
