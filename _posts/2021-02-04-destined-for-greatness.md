<h2>Feeling we are capable of so much more</h2>

Have you ever felt that you were destined for “better” things? So many people admit to this. What does it mean? Some imagine that they are destined to make a difference to the world as writers, scientists, leaders – but few achieve these goals. So, what is the basis of this feeling and have they “failed”?

<h2>Another possibility</h2>

Perhaps the greatness these people have imagined – perhaps you have imagined – is something different than financial success or popularity. Perhaps the greatness imagined is an understanding that we all contain all we need – that all of the answers we seek are actually already inside of ourselves and have always been. 

<h2>You are nobility</h2>
