<h2>Talking With Others</h2>

<p>I have long liked the analogy of counselling to sitting around a campfire and discussing things. Perhaps it takes me back to somewhere in our collective history where we sat around a fire at the end of a long day (maybe travelling to new places) and shared with each other over the warmth and a meal. This image brings me comfort.</p> 

<h2>Counselling as Sharing</h2>

<p>We have made sharing our problems into "therapy" - we shared our problems with others for eons before counselling began. We have always looked to others for comfort and now in an age of the secular nuclear family, we have lost the traditional ties of extended family and religious ceremonies where we can share our grief, fear, shame and other emotions. It is my perspective that we need to build up new ways to share that don't involve a medical model of pathology (illness) in relation to mental health.</p> 

<h2>Therapy Aroha Ltd</h2>

<p>The image for Therapy Aroha Ltd is a campfire. This place of warmth and comfort is a place for sharing. Perhaps you are travelling alone and want to come sit by the fire. Perhaps you have stories you want to tell. Perhaps you want to sit by the fire and take comfort hearing from others and knowing that you are not alone. Welcome to the fire, whānau!</p>
