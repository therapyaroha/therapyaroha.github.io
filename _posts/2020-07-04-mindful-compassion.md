<h2>Compassion-Focused Therapy</h2>

<p>Paul Gilbert created Compassion-Focused Therapy and in this text he is joined by Choden, a mindfulness and compassion facilitator. The book is good for those who want an introduction to the ideas of compassion and how the mind is "wired" for it - sort of a primer on Gilbert's ideas developed further in other texts.</p> 

<p>It is also the opportunity for Gilbert to be joined by a long-term meditator (Choden is a former Buddhist monk). While the text is a decent introduction to the ideas of focusing on compassion, it is a bit weak in the actual application of mindfulness and compassion. It is possible to talk about meditation and not actually sit to practice it and this text feels a bit like that.</p> 

<p>Want a primer? This book might help.</p>
