<h2>Meditation and Mindfulness in Therapy</h2>

<p>Many people ask me what place meditation has in therapy. Often I get asked if this is some sort of religious practice. People have a number of reactions around these questions. As I have just finished meditating (the photo of me on this page is post-meditation) and am in a very good space mentally, I will attempt a start of a response - this is only a start, as the topic of meditation is a large one (and paradoxically quite straight-forward).</p>

<h2>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy</h2>

<p>First, meditation has found application in a number of therapeutic approaches, including a central place in a synthesis between mindfulness (meditation) and Cognitive Therapy, known as <em>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy</em>. This approach was developed at Oxford University and a good introduction is found in their podcasts <a href="http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-new-approach-treating-depression" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Oxford did research into the use of mindfulness meditation and cognitive techniques to treat depression. A very interesting project!</p>

<h2>Meditation as Focusing</h2>

<p>Second, meditation is as simple as focusing on your breath (something that is always readily available). The focal point can be a number of things. An exhaustive list is note possible but it could include:

<ul>
<li>focusing on your breath </li>
<li>focusing on a flame </li>
<li>focusing on chanting </li>
<li>focusing on mala beads which chanting </li>	<li>focusing on the food you are eating </li> 	<li>focusing on the sensations of your feet making contact with the ground (referred to as <em>walking meditation</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Meditation is focusing - it would be a stretch to say that focusing is a purely religious act and I would suggest it is not. There are also other sorts of meditation - including loving-kindness mediation, which I will discuss at some point on this site in relation to <em>Compassion-Focused Therapy</em>.</p>

<h2>Meditation in Therapy</h2>

<p>So, how does meditation help in therapy? Some ways include:

<ul>
<li>focusing stills the mind</li>
<li>focusing can allow us to "sit with" unpleasant thoughts and emotions</li>
<li>focusing helps to centre a person in the body</li>
<li>focusing allows a person to see thoughts come and go and helps the person to realise that they are more than just these fleeting thoughts</li>
<li>focusing helps in therapy including pain management</li>
<li>focusing can help with anxiety and depression (but support needs to be provided initially)</li></ul>

<h2>Trying Mindfulness and Meditation</h2>

<p>We are more than our fleeting thoughts, which seem to crowd our mind every waking moment. Learning to still our minds and sit with thoughts (some unpleasant) gives us a new vantage point to understand ourselves and our interactions with stimuli. Also, it can bring incredible calm to life! I once told a friend that meditation was the greatest gift I had ever given myself. If you try it, <span class="highlight-text">remember to be gentle on yourself - there is no "right" way and don't be down on yourself if you can't focus at first</span>. Learning to do so is the whole reason to practice - and it is exactly that, a practice.</p>

<p>Aroha nui,</p>
