<h2>Narrative Therapy Course</h2>

<p>I spent last week in Adelaide studying Narrative Therapy. The course was at the Dulwich Centre and the students were a global mix from places including Hong Kong, South Africa, the USA, New Zealand and Australia. It was quite an interesting and insightful experience and the closest I came to a holiday this year! I will discuss my insights as this site is developed.</p>

<p>Once the course was finished, I got this certificate for the week. Looking forward to what's ahead!</p>
