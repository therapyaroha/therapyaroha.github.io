<h2>Gifts From My Son</h2>

My son was awake until almost 3am this morning, making my birthday presents. Whenever he asks what I want, it is always something made by him. These were my presents today, my 53rd birthday!

<h2>New Zealand Pōhutukawa</h2>

This is of one of our most iconic trees, the pōhutukawa.

<h2>Brandenburger Tor (Brandenburg Gate)</h2>

My son knows this has significance for me, both as a student in 1989 West Berlin and also for the trip he and I took to Europe in 2018.
