<h2>Our Shared Nobility</h2>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;O Nobly Born, O you of glorious origins, remember your radiant true nature, the essence of mind. Trust it. Return to it. It is home.&quot; (The Tibetan Book of the Dead) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/compassion?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#compassion</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mindfulness?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mindfulness</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/therapy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#therapy</a></p>&mdash; ❤️ Therapy Aroha Ltd (@therapyaroha) <a href="https://twitter.com/therapyaroha/status/1324453250813235200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>

<h2>Perspective on Self</h2>

<p>Many have an inner voice that either suggests they are worthless, or discounts their every accomplishment. Yes, there are a few people who inflate their accomplishments, but this could be argued to be an attempt to compensate for personal feelings of inadequacy in many instances. The prevalence of depression in the modern world suggests that we tend to be critical of our lives. Is there another way to deal with our negative self-talk?</p>

<h2>Focusing on our Inner Value</h2>

<p>I love this quote from <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> because it encourages us to trust our inner wisdom. It also speaks of our innate dignity. These are powerful ideas and worthy of our consideration. Imagine for a moment that we are all noble and wise and that this includes you. This doesn't take anything from another, but adds to us all. We are all lifted up, together!</p>

<p>Try to emphasise this for a few days. Repeat this quote. Look around you at others and see their nobility. Look in the mirror and see your own. Imagine that there is wisdom inside of you. Be kind to yourself, oh you of noble birth!</p>

<p>See the shift in perspective that this will bring, both in your relating with self, and your relating with others.</p>

<p>Aroha nui,</p>
